# n-Heads-Probability
This program takes a number of flipped "coins", represented by data sets of randomly selected H's and T's and determines the probability of getting all heads for a given data set size selected by the user. The program also takes input from the user as for how many times to run the simulation or how many data sets to make the calculation based on. This program is a generalization of the previous FiveHeadsProbability program I made.
